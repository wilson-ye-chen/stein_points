# Stein Points
## Purpose
This repository provides MATLAB implementations of point-sequence and
point-set construction algorithms for approximating an arbitrary target
distribution by directly minimising the Kernelised Stein Discrepancy (KSD).
It also provides MATLAB implementations of other discrete approximation
algorithms such as the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) and the
Minimum Energy Design (MED).
